# Credit_Card_Default_Prediction

This Dataset is historical dataset of Taiwan having all details of Credit Card users ,
It Comprises of 30,000 rows x 25 columns , having all essential information of users , like Credit limit , Gender , Age , marital Status, Education level , Past billed amount , History of past payments etc. 


The Problem statement is to predict about the customers that whether a particular customer will default on their payment or not ,
We aimed to assess the dataset using all given independent Variables , followed by application of all algorithms and metrics on it  ,Our Perspective was to use all above iterated information and to prepare a model which can predict using all those details that  whether a particular customer will default on payment or not ,
Looking at the data we plotted all the information graphically to analyze them, then we also dropped a column and checked all columns for multi collinearity ,


Thereafter that we have implemented below Algorithms on it :-
Logistics Regression
KNN
Na√Øve Bayes
SVM
XG boost &
Decision Tree 
Along with All above algorithms we have used below Metrics to analyze various scores ,
Accuracy 
Precision 
Recall
F1 Score
ROC
Confusion Matrix

Our Findings are :-

People aged 28-40 yrs are the highest users of Credit Cards.
Female Users are around 40% more than Male users .
Percentage of Defaulters are around 25% of the NON Defaulters .
Students of University uses Credit cards most, followed by Graduates. 
Percentage of  Unmarried Credit Card users are around 20%  more than Married People.
Males default More on payments as compared to ladies ,
Credit limit of Males are slightly lesser than females .
Singles use credit cards more than the Married ones . 
Married People default on payment very less as compared to singles.
Graduation Students defaults on payments much more than University students .

Final Conclusion :-
Married ,more Educated Female Credit Card Users , whose age is between 28-37 and are least likely to default on their payments ,
And Single Men , less educated whose ages are lesser than 28 or more than 37 are most likely to default on payments ,
Accordingly the company can device their target customer strategy for the above Niche Market.,
